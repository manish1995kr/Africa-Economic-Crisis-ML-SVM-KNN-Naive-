# Africa-Economic-Crisis-ML-SVM-KNN-Naive-

In this project I used the Pandas, Matplotlib, MinMaxScaler, smote, and Machine Learning. 
 Pandas is used for data loader and we can check if there is any null value in the data or not or it is also used to check 
 the info of data and we can also get the many detail regarding the data. We can compare the different column of data 
 and check the relation between them. We can check the unique word and value in the column by the use of the pandas. 
 Matplotlib is used in this project to check the outlier in the data. If there is any outlier then we use the minmaxscaler 
 To set the column in the range and remove the outlier. 
Smote is used to solve the imbalance problem in the data. When we split the data in x and y form then y output have 
mismatch data. So all y output data should be equal we use the smote. It help in Machine Learning. 
In this project the machine learning algorithms used is (Kneighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector 
Machine). First we split the data in train and test form then we fit the x and y train data in algorithms and train the ML 
and after that predict the y output and then check the pred output with the original output with the use of the 
classification report we get the precision, recall, f1-score etc with this. We do this all three algorithm to check which 
one is best fit.
